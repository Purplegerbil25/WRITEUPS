SSH (Secure Shell) is used to connect to servers. Mac operating sysytems already have an SSH client installed...now we must enable it! Let's go!

Step 1: Open a terminal 
Open a terminal on your VM (Kali)
Step 2: ifconfig
Insert ifconfig 
This will gives us our ip address. Look for eth0 ip address and copy (otherwise memorize :P )

Step 3: netstat -natp
Insert netstat -natp
This will show us what ports are open

Step 4: sudo systemctl status ssh.service
Insert sudo systemctl status ssh.service
Take a look and see if its is active and running in your system so you can connect
Type your password when prompted, and type q to exit and execute the next command

Step 5: sudo systemctl start ssh.service
Insert systemctl start ssh
no additional text will appear

Step 6: sudo systemctl status ssh.service
Insert sudo systemctl status ssh.service once again to doublecheck your port is open
Type q to exit the text and continue on

Step 7: netstat -natp
Insert netstat -natp once again

Step 8: Move to your host terminal
In your host/local terminal insert ssh username@ip address
Enter your passwrd if prompted
